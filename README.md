## Stock Crawler & Analysis

### Introduction
-----
In this project, you will be able to download stock data from Yahoo Finance and then visualize the data you get through making different plots. Although you may not be able to come up with precise predictions of how the stock will behave from the plots made in this project, but it's fun to make these plots yourself to compare with plots we see from finance websites and get a general feeling of how the stock behaved in the days passed.  

Ok, let's get started!

## Getting Started
There are a number of steps for this project to finish the crawling the analysis tasks. First step is crawling data from Yahoo Finance and store the stock data into a .json file. 


In a candlestick chart, a green candlestick means the closing price is higher than the open price and a red candlestick means the closing price is higher than the open price. This presentation method of using red as gain and green as loss is commonly used in stock markets in China.
